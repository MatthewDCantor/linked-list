## Shell Commands

`ls` - List directory
`cd` - Change directory
`cat` - Concatenate - Easy way to print out a file. Best for small files
`less` - Easy way to view larger files


## Text Editor

Use an IDE if you like, but I recommend learning either Vim or Emacs. They
are the holy relics of computer science. They have a steep learning curve,
but once you master it your productivity will be 10x that of someone on an
IDE.

For the meantime, just use an IDE that lets you code and jump into Vim or 
Emacs when you really start to get serious. They are worth the time
investment.


I use Vim, but if I'm using an IDE I'll try and find an add-on that has Vim
key-bindings.
